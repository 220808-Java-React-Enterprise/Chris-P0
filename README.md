# Buy-N-Large: Used Spaceships

## Description
Welcome patron. Are you planning a trip to Alpha Centauri or the Lessor Magellanic Cloud? Perhaps a pesky neighbor in a neighboring star system needs "dealing with". Maybe you just want to surf Saturn's Rings in comfort and style. Whatever your needs, Buy-N-Large has just the spaceship for you.
Buy-N-Large partners with a consortium of enterprising pioneers to bring you a wide array of spaceships for reasonable prices. (Buy-N-Large denies any involvement with the Interplanetary Space Pirate League. Don't ask where the ships came from.) All of our ships are kitted out and polished to a shine, or your money back. (All transactions are final.) Stop at any one of our automated terminals located on the concourse deck of your local commerce station and log on in. Your new ride is just a few inputs away.

## Usage
Simply type out your responses to the Buy-N-Large automated terminals' prompts the terminal will handle the rest.

Press 'enter' to submit a response or press 'x' to return to the previous prompt.

All monetary compensations will be automatically deducted from your personal credit account at the time of purchase. Any remaining balance will be collected from your personal assets by a Buy-N-Large collection specialist. (Buy-N-Large is not responsible for any personal harm or loss of life accrued during the collection process.) All transactions will be billed in Earth Dollars. No automatic currency conversion is supported except for Schmeckles to Earth Dollars.
